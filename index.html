    Notes:
    - I SPENT LIKE TWO DAYS MAKING THIS WEBSITE WITH BOOTSTRAP LIKE A HECKIN' GOOBER ONLY TO FINALLY DOUBLE CHECK AND SEE WE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO USE IT SO UH... REFACTORING TIME!
    - Update I have 4 hours left... Yeah I do NOT have the time to recreate the effects from Bootstrap with my current skillset and time left. Time to curb my perfectionism and revisit some old favorite designs I fall back onto.

                <p>It&apos;s nice to (indirectly) meet you! I&apos;m Richard Tanner West, but I&apos;ve always gone by Tanner. I&apos;m an avid learner with a history of writing and programming! From a very young age the creativity in writing and the logic of code have captivated me.</p>
                <p>When it comes to writing, I most enjoy high fantasy, but I can be a real sucker for a good sci-fi. As for software dev, I most enjoy working in Python! But I&apos;ll detail more about that below.</p>

                <h2>Skills &amp; Experience</h2>
                <p>Over the years of self-study, hours of code, and classes in both high school and college I&apos;ve picked up quite the range of different language proficiencies. I consider myself proficient with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python (My favorite)</li>

                    <li>SQL/SQLite</li>
                    <li>... and more by the project and semester</li>
